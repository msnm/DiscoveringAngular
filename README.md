In this repo my adventures in Angular can be found.


## HospitalApp
A schoolproject and also my first little project in NG. Goal was to make an overview of rooms and their patients in a hospital, so that nurses have dashboard of which patients needs which treatment and when. 

To run open the hospital backend and run: 
node app.js 

Then open the HospitalApp folder and run in the root folder
ng serve
